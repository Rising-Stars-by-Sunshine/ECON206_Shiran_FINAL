# Questions

**Question 1**

**When computer science meets economics**: Who do you truly want to become? Pick one of your favorite Nobel Prize winners (https://www.nobelprize.org/) and Turing Award winners (https://amturing.acm.org/). How do you want to contribute to the intersection of the two north stars to advance human civilizations? 

**Question 2**

**CS&Econ for a Better Future**: How do you perceive the synergy between computer science and economics as a catalyst for steering innovation toward a brighter future? Please present a foundational assertion, followed by multiple specific instances that support your claim, including a reference to a topic discussed at the colloquium on Friday, March 22.

**Question 3**

**Beyond CS & Econ**: How are aspects of human nature, like bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies, such as generative AI, reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts? Additionally, how might this interplay be perceived and conceptualized distinctively from current models? Address this inquiry by drawing upon the literature covered in our lectures and supplementary scholarly works, ensuring to include in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography.

# Answers

**Question 1**

Favorite Nobel Winner: Albert Camus, Philosopher and Writer

Favorite Turing Winner: Geoffrey Hinton, Deep Learning Trailblazer

Intersection: Using deep learning techniques, one (hopefully) can eventually construct machines that are capable of reasoning and thus understanding & reproducing Camus's thoughts and writings. Whether doing so is safe is still unknown though: Hinton has warned against creating such AGIs on multiple occasions. 

**Question 2**

Computer Science and Economics, taken together, can act as a major thrusting force for the fourth industrial revolution. On one hand, current developments in computer science, such as Artificial Intelligence, can empower the advancement of economics, enabling the creation of tools such as predictors and assistants which can then greatly aid of human economic transactions and discourse. On the other hand, economics can also be a useful tool for understanding how to convert technological advances in computer science into entrepreneurial ideas or practical inventions. Hence the two academic disciplines can jointly act as catalysts for progress in innovation in the modern world towards a better future.

**Question 3**

Dafoe et al. (2021) mentioned the importance of cooperation between machines for future technologies, and it seems that advances in techniques such as multi-agent reinforcement learning (Zhou, Liu, and Tang 2023) could enable that. Meanwhile, however, cooperation between humans and machines are becoming difficult due to the machines being predictable while the humans exhibiting unpredictable and stochastic behavior such as bounded rationality, which has been a important topic of research (Bettis and Hu 2018). Some have proposed embedding such attributes into machines, which generative models might be able to help with (Dick 2015).
