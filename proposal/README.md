_What are the gaps between the existing literature and the pressing social and economic issues in the digital economy of complex system involving both human and AI agent that inspires your research?_

My motivation is seeing gaps in behavior observed experimentally in real life, versus relatively simplistic predictions given by current economical models. While much previous work aims to address this problem of human irrationality in real life, the direction I propose, temporal factors in utility discount is new and unexplored.

_What are the questions that your research intends to answer?_

Core question: How do we take temporal factors for utility into account in game theory modeling, and produce interpretable results from those models?

_Why are the questions important?_

This question can serve as the bridge between behavioral scientific observations and theoretical economics (game theory in particular).

_Why are the questions not answered by existing game theory literature?_

The issue has been neglected since much research on it has been done in the behavioral science field. This leaves game theory a forgotten tool in interdisciplinary modeling.

_In which real-world situation does your newly proposed game and/or solution concept or mechanism apply?_

Some concrete examples are provided in the paper. However, our work is purely theoretical in nature, and is not targeted at any specific real-world scenario.

_What is the literature in other discipline such as psychology that could provide a behavioral foundation of your newly proposed game and/or solution concept, or mechanism?_

Literature in behavioral science on topics such as self control and delayed gratification can be useful.

_What is the key game theoretical or mechanism design framework that you build upon?_

Normal form games, although extensive form games can also be applied.

_What is the key computational or analytical tools that you apply to answer your requestion question?_

Mainly manual calculation, though there is an interactive demo for solving a complex problem via Nashpy.

_What is the advanced technology or interdisciplinary insights that you integrate into the existing methods that smartly solve your research question?_

Mainly mathematical modeling.

_Can you provide a concrete illustration example of game theory or mechanism design that your approach significantly improves at least one objective of human welfare compared to existing research without your approach?_

Please refer to the paper, which provides plenty.

_Can you demonstrate the limitation of your current research that would inspire future research? For example, what are the other important objectives of human welfare that you approach does not consider yet?_

Our work is theoretical, and we consider its bridging to praxis to be an interesting direction for future research.

_Can you elaborate on how your research can be applied to improve individual, company, and government decisions in strategic scenarios or social choice issues?_

Some examples of applying our research to individual affairs can be seen in the paper.
